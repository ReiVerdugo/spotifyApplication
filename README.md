# spotifyApplication
This repository contains an Application Test that uses Spotify's API.

The first view shows a collection of artists who match with user's search.
- If the user pulls the scroll view, a refresh of the last artist's search occurs.

Once the users select any of the artists, a second view with additional information is displayed, such as:
- Name, photo, followers and popularity.
- A list of artist's albums displaying their names, photo and markets where they are available (up to five)

# Usage
Libraries are integrated using Cocoapods, so .xcworkspace should be compiled and run instead of .xcodeproj
